# TimeToKill
This is an actually working TimeToKill version that I made for the Vanilla 1.12 client. 
Part of the credit goes to [jrc13245](https://github.com/jrc13245/TimeToKill).

## Features
Calculates the time until the boss dies every second.

## Customization
To edit the update interval, change the `checkInterval` value (in seconds). To edit the position, change `X_Offset` and `Y_offset`.
No SavedVariables because I'm lazy !!!!! fuck you
